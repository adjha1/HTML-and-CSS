    <!-- Universal Selector -->
    <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>

    <!-- Type Selector -->
    <p>This is a paragraph styled by the Type Selector (p)</p>

    <!-- Class Selector -->
    <p class="highlight">This paragraph has a yellow background because of the class selector.</p>

    <!-- ID Selector -->
    <p id="unique">This paragraph is bold and red due to the ID selector.</p>

    <!-- Attribute Selector -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This link is green because it uses the attribute selector for HTTPS links.</a><br>
    <a href="http://www.example.com">This link does not match the attribute selector.</a>

    <!-- Descendant Selector -->
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is purple and inside a div, targeted by the descendant selector.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This paragraph is not inside a div, so it’s unaffected by the descendant selector.</p>

    <!-- Child Selector -->
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is orange because it is a direct child of a div.</p>
        <section>
            <p>This paragraph is not orange because it is inside a section, not directly under the div.</p>
        </section>
    </div>

    <!-- Adjacent Sibling Selector -->
    <h1>This heading is followed by a paragraph</h1>
    <p>This paragraph is teal because it's immediately after the h1 heading (adjacent sibling selector).</p>

    <!-- General Sibling Selector -->
    <h1>This heading has several sibling paragraphs.</h1>
    <p>This paragraph is italicized because it’s a sibling of the h1 heading (general sibling selector).</p>
    <p>This paragraph is also italicized for the same reason.</p>

    <!-- Pseudo-Class Selector -->
    <a href="#">Hover over me to change my color to red</a>
    <p>This is the second paragraph, which has a larger font size due to the nth-child pseudo-class selector.</p>

    <!-- Pseudo-Element Selector -->
    <p>This paragraph has content before it due to the ::before pseudo-element.</p>

    <!-- Grouped Selector -->
    <h2>This heading and the following paragraph are both dark blue.</h2>
    <p>This paragraph is dark blue because of the grouped selector.</p>

</body>
